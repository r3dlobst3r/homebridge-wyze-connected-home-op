[![homebridge-wyze-connected-home-op: Wyze Connected Home plugin for Homebridge & Hoobs](https://github.com/ndejong5/homebridge-wyze-connected-home-op/blob/master/wyze%20hoobs%20logo.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/ndejong5/homebridge-wyze-connected-home-op)

# homebridge-wyze-connected-home

This plugin adds support for Wyze Connected Home devices to [Homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge) & [Hoobs](https://github.com/hoobs-org/HOOBS).

## Supported Devices
- Light Bulb
- Plug
- Outdoor Plug
- V1 Contact Sensor
- V1 Motion Sensor

## Added User-Agent Header to API call to avoid 403 Forbidden 

For more information about our version updates, please check our [change log](CHANGELOG.md).

## Configuration

Use the settings UI in Homebridge Config UI X to configure your Wyze account, or manually add the following to the platforms section of your config file:

```js
{
  "platforms": [
    {
      "platform": "WyzeConnectedHome",
      "name": "Wyze",
      "username": "YOUR_EMAIL",
      "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD",
      "mfaCode": "YOUR_2FA_AUTHENTICATION_PIN"
    }
  ]
}
```

Supported devices will be discovered and added to Homebridge automatically.

### Optional fields

* **`mfaCode`** &ndash; Only required for the initial login if you have two-factor authentication enabled for your account. This is typically a 6-digit code provided by your authenticator app.
* **`refreshInterval`** &ndash; Defines how often the status of the devices will be polled in milliseconds (e.g., `"refreshInterval": 5000` will check the status of your devices' status every 5 seconds). Defaults to 10 seconds.
* **`phoneId`** &ndash; The phone id used by the Wyze App. This value is just found by intercepting your phone's traffic. If no `phoneId` is specified, a default value will be used.

## Other Info

Special thanks to the following projects for reference and inspiration:
* **[ha-wyzeapi](https://github.com/JoshuaMulliken/ha-wyzeapi)**, a Wyze integration for Home Assistant
* **[wyze-node](https://github.com/noelportugal/wyze-node)**, a Node library for the Wyze API

Also, thanks to the [contributors](https://github.com/misenhower/homebridge-wyze-connected-home/graphs/contributors) who volunteered their time to help add support for more devices and features.

This was just a small project for me to be able to get the 403 error fix into hoobs. I do not have much coding experince so there won't be a ton of updates. If anyone is willing to edit code to add future devices be my guest!
